# Fi-Zen Login Screen Demo

## Overview
I've successfully created a comprehensive login/signup screen with a grid of 16 test user profiles. Each profile includes:

- **Avatar image** (from the existing 16 avatar assets)
- **Full name** (Indian names)
- **Location** (Indian cities and states)
- **Profession** (various job roles)
- **Financial data** (balance, net worth)

## Features Implemented

### üéØ **User Profile Grid**
- **4x4 grid layout** displaying all 16 test users
- **Responsive design** that adapts to screen width
- **Visual selection** with border highlighting and checkmark badge
- **Smooth animations** with staggered FadeInUp effects

### üë§ **Test User Profiles**
```javascript
// Sample profiles include:
{
  name: 'Arjun Sharma',
  location: 'Mumbai, Maharashtra', 
  profession: 'Software Engineer',
  balance: 125000.50,
  netWorth: -50000,
  avatar: 1
}
```

### üîê **Authentication Flow**
- **Profile selection** ‚Üí **Login confirmation** ‚Üí **Navigate to main app**
- **Logout functionality** in ProfileScreen with confirmation dialog

### üé® **UI/UX Features**

## File Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screens/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LoginScreen.js          # Main login/profile selection screen
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UserProfileService.js   # Enhanced user management service
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DataService.js          # Updated to use UserProfileService
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ navigation/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AppNavigator.js         # Updated with login flow
```

## How It Works

### 1. **App Startup**
- App checks if user is logged in via `UserProfileService.isLoggedIn()`
- Shows LoginScreen if not logged in, otherwise shows main app

### 2. **Profile Selection**
- User sees 4x4 grid of 16 test profiles
- Each card shows avatar, name, location, and profession
- Tapping a card selects it (visual feedback with border + checkmark)
- Selected user details appear in expanded card below

### 3. **Login Process**
- "Continue to App" button becomes active when user is selected
- Sets selected user as current user in UserProfileService
- Navigates to main app (TabNavigator)

### 4. **Profile Integration**
- ProfileScreen now shows current user's actual data
- Displays user's avatar, name, location, and profession
- Includes logout option that returns to LoginScreen
